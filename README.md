KIRI HackJak is an app that participates in the [HackJak](http://hackjak.bappeda.go.id/) competition.

We focus on these features (top priorities first):

* SQLite and update data feature
* Latlon path input for about 50 tracks of Mikrolet, through angkot.web.id website.
* Text-to-speech and/or speech input feature for the blind
* Link to [angkot.web.id](http://www.angkot.web.id) for latlon path contribution.
* Admob (activated after 7 days), and a link to donate as well as remove ad.
* Data cleaning (e.g. "Jl. DI Panjaitan" vs "Jl. DI. Panjaitan")
* Link to this github site for source code contribution.
* List of all available tracks
* Interesting places feature (using geofences? data source?)
