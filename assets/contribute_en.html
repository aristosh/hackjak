<h1>Data Contribution</h1>
<p>This KIRI HackJak app is made using government's open data. Altough with many datasets (550 tracks+), but the data only as detail as road names. For more advanced usage, a more precise data is needed, which is the latitude/longitude list which can be only inputted from map. With a more precise data, route searching becomes more accurate, as in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=travel.kiri.smarttransportapp">Smart Public Transport</a> app for Bandung.</p>

<p><em>How can I help?</em></p>

<p>Help us migrate each UKP4's trayek data to a non-profit site Peta Angkutan Umum, using the guidelines provided in <a href="http://hackjak.kiri.travel">http://hackjak.kiri.travel</a>. The data you input will help, belongs to public, and can be used for a better app!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
